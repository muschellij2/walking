\title{Finds walking and calculate steps from raw acceleration data.}
\usage{
find_walking(
  data,
  sample_rate = 10L,
  min_amplitude = 0.3,
  step_frequency = c(1.4, 2.3),
  alpha = 0.6,
  beta = 2.5,
  min_duration_peak = 3L,
  delta = 20L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sample_rate}{sampling frequency (in Hz) \strong{for analyzing walking}.
Note, this is \strong{NOT} the sampling frequency of the data.}

\item{min_amplitude}{minimum amplitude (in g)}

\item{step_frequency}{step frequency range}

\item{alpha}{maximum ratio between dominant peak below
and within step frequency range}

\item{beta}{maximum ratio between dominant peak above
and within step frequency range}

\item{min_duration_peak}{minimum duration of peaks (in seconds)}

\item{delta}{maximum difference between consecutive peaks
(in multiplication of 0.05Hz)}
}
\value{
A vector of number of steps per second
}
\description{
Method finds periods of repetitive and continuous oscillations with
predominant frequency occurring within know step frequency range.
Frequency components are extracted with Continuous Wavelet Transform.
